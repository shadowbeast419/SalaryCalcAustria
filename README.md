# SalaryCalcAustria
 Python script to find your perfect matching salary and working hours.

This script is a shortcut for manually entering numbers inside online gross-net-calculators.
Just change the constants close to the top of the file and look at the console-output.

I used it for calculating the perfect gross salary for my maximum amount of hours I want to work.
